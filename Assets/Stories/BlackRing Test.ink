// THINGS TO NOTE/QUESTIONS
/*
    - Do we want to make use of quotations?
    - Is an emotion tag required? Or shall we always use a default character asset if an emotion tag is not specified?
    -     * p: [ Poke her shoulder ] Would something like this require a character prefix? To denote who does an action? Also it would it be p: [ Poke her shoulder ] not [ p: Poke her shoulder ]? Note how 'p:' produces a new line at the "Poke her shoulder" option
    - Note that while making a loop id you say "no" to dying a horrible death it removes the option to say no on the next go
